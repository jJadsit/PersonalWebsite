Jonathen's Personal Website

Introduction
Hello, this is my website! Currently I don't have a server to host the site on (I'm a broke student), so GitHub will have to host the site for me. Not that there is much to host anyways, the site is rather barren and a WIP.
I'm not sure what will go on this site, it will probably be slowly updated over time.
There is currently one feature that will be implemented and that is a feature to draw a colored box from some input.
Aside from that I will probably put an About Me page that will talk almost exculsively about my obsession with Jazz and fine hats, and have almost no information relevant to anyone.

I'm completely aware the site looks like total garbage right now. I'll pretty it up over the next X days/weeks/months/years.
